rtl_tcp_andro 

Is an application that allows you to use I/Q packet source in your Android applications.

All you need is to launch an intent in the form "iqsrc://rtl_tcp_arguments" where you replace rtl_tcp_arguments with the arguments that you want your application to run rtl_tcp with and the magic will be done behind the scenes! More HOWTO coming soon!

Internals:

A modification of rtl_tcp and libusb-1.0 for running on Android (also works on other Linux based systems) 
 
It is compatible with the original rtl_tcp with the following exceptions: 
 
Added features: 
 - Opening devices using a file descriptor (very important for Android) 
 - An additional command for closing the app remotely and setting tuner gain in percentage 
 
Possible bugs: 
 - Once the client closes, rtl_tcp closes with it. This is a desired behavior on Android but probably undesired if used for a client. 
 
Note: 
The rtl-sdr folder is completely unmodified. Therefore if a new version of rtl-sdr is released, just replace this folder with the newer version and recompile - everything should work out of the box if the rtlsdr_open function is unchanged. If the rtlsdr_open was modified in the new version, you would need to update rtl_tcp_andro.c and the rtlsdr_open2 function.
 
Files modified in libusb-1.0 to create libusb-andro: 
 core.c, libusb.h and libusbi.h - to header for and implementation of the open2 function which takes an already open file descriptor 
 linux_usbfs.c - to create a libusb handle from the fd 
 
Compilation: 
To compile for Android, use the Android.mk file in the jni directory 
 
The modifications are released under GNU. See COPYING for details.
