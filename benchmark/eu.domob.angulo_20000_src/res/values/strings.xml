which the device (the camera, to be precise) is held.  Use the form below to
enter the height in metres, or let Angulo measure it by dropping the device
(on a <b>suitably soft floor</b>!)
and measuring the time.</string>

  <string name="help_link_para">See also the

details.</string>

  <string name="help_classic_para1">To measure an angle (slope or inclination),
simply point the device into one direction, press <b>Set</b>, and point
it into the other direction.</string>
  <string name="help_classic_para2">Then the rotation angle relative to gravity
(down) and magnetic field (towards magnetic pole) is displayed.  The green
number is a combined, usually more accurate angle.</string>
  <string name="help_classic_para3">For easy reading, you can also <b>Freeze</b>
(and later <b>Unfreeze</b>).  <b>Level</b> sets the reference direction to
one of the principal axes of the device instead, so that it can be used as
water-level.</string>

  <string name="help_triangulo_para1">Point the camera focus towards a target
on the floor, and the distance to it will be calculated from the angle the
device has with respect to the direction of gravity.</string>
  <string name="help_triangulo_para2">Note that in order to get correct
results, there must not be an inclination of the floor towards the target!
Also ensure that you configure the height at which the device (the camera,
to be precise) is held correctly.</string>
  <string name="help_triangulo_para3">The distance displayed is the distance
between the device\'s projection onto the floor and the target.  If you think
of the point where you are standing on the floor, consider also the distance
the device is held in front of your body!</string>
