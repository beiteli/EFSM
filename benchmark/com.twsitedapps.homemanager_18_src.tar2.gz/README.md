What is a Home App?
===================

A Home App, or sometimes called a "Launcher" is the main UI (User's Interface) displayed after
hitting the Home button. This UI should let you access all of the other features on your Android
Device. The reason to change to a new Home App depends on an individuals customization preference
on how they would like their device to function and look. If you are familiar with the Desktop
terminology then a Home App is Androidâ€™s Desktop.

Show Home App memory usage if the Home App is running.

The following options are supported:

    Notification:
    	Quickly change to a new home app
    	Clear the Notification
    	Disable the Notification
    Clear Default:
        This action will take you to the Installed App details; which will allow you to select
        "Clear Defaults". Then hit the back button to get back to THM.
    Set Default:
        This action will bring up a dialog to select an installed Home App and set it as the default.
    Get Home:
        This action will bring up a dialog to select Home Apps that are on the Android Market.
